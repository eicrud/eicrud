Most of Eicrud's application configuration is done through the `CrudConfigService`. 
```typescript title="eicrud.config.service.ts"
@Injectable()
export class MyConfigService extends CrudConfigService {

    constructor(
        public userService: UserService,
        public entityManager: EntityManager,
        public emailService: EmailService,
        protected orm: MikroORM
    ) {
        super({
            userService,
            entityManager,
            emailService,
            jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
            cacheManager: new BasicMemoryCache(),
            orm,
            id_field: 'id',
            dbAdapter: new MongoDbAdapter(),
        });

        this.addRoles(roles);
    }

}
```

## Hooks
You can override some of your `CrudConfigService`'s methods, to define hooks for your applications.

**Crud hooks** are called before and after [CRUD](../services/operations.md) and [CMD](../services/commands.md) operations (at the controller level).
```typescript
override async afterCrudHook(res: any, ctx: CrudContext) {
    return Promise.resolve();
}
    
override async beforeCrudHook(ctx: CrudContext){
    return Promise.resolve();
}

override async errorCrudHook(error: Error, ctx: CrudContext){
    return Promise.resolve();
}
```
!!! note
    **Crud hooks** will only trigger on operations initiated form the [client](../client/setup.md). Internal service calls will not trigger.

**Backdoor hooks** are called before and after a backdoor request is received in a [microservice](../microservices/configuration.md).
```typescript
override async afterBackdoorHook(res: any, ctx: CrudContext) {
    return Promise.resolve();
}

override async beforeBackdoorHook(ctx: CrudContext){
    return Promise.resolve();
}

override async errorBackdoorHook(error: Error, ctx: CrudContext){
    return Promise.resolve();
}
```
!!! note
    It's better not to await function calls inside hooks when possible, this way errors won't prevent a request from returning data.


## Events
You can override some "event" methods as well.

**onHighTrafficEvent** will trigger when an abnormal amount of traffic is detected for a particular user.
```typescript
override async onHighTrafficEvent(count, user: CrudUser, ctx: CrudContext){
    return Promise.resolve();
}
```
